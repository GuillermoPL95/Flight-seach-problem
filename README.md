# Flight Search problem

* This is a programming problem which, given a database and an input, implements a flight search that returns a list of available flights and prices.

* This solution was developed in two different java files: 
 * A Factory file that loads and stores the data from the csv files 
 * A FlightsManager file that executes the flight search 
 
* Also, a main file that works as a client with some examples was provided.
* The CsvFiles file and the data files were provided with the statement.

## Considerations

* Four functional tests cases were developed for this solution. However, due to time issues I couldn't be able to write a better and bigger ones.
* More examples can be added to the Main.java file, following the other examples' structure.
* A .gitignore file might be included in next commits.
